# Y‚ÄîChat

Y‚ÄîChat is a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) project that provides a simple API for integrating the powerful ChatGPT language model developed by OpenAI into mobile applications running on multi platforms. The goal of this project is to abstract all the API call logic from ChatGPT, allowing developers to easily leverage the capabilities of the language model in their mobile applications.

The repository contains the source code for the Y‚ÄîChat library, along with examples and documentation for getting started with the library. The Y‚ÄîChat library provides a consistent interface for interacting with ChatGPT, regardless of the platform, and makes it easy to generate human-like text based on a given prompt or context.

The library uses Kotlin Multiplatform to generate artifacts for both iOS, macOS, Android and JVM, allowing developers to write code once and use it on multiple platforms. The project is open source and actively maintained, with contributions from the community encouraged. Overall, Y‚ÄîChat provides a convenient and powerful way for mobile developers to incorporate the advanced natural language processing capabilities of ChatGPT into their applications.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting Started

### iOS setup

- Go to your project‚Äôs file settings and click "Add Package":

- To add a new package, search for https://github.com/yml-org/ychat.git in the top right corner:

Once you have found the package click the "Add Package" button to add it to your project. Now you can start using the SDK in your iOS project!

See the code snippet below on how to initialize and use it one of the supported feature:

```swift
var yChat: YChat {
    YChatCompanion.shared.create(apiKey: "your-api-key") 
}

do {
  let result = try await chatGpt.completion()
                    .setInput(input: "Say this is a test.")
                    .setMaxTokens(tokens: 1024)
                    .saveHistory(isSaveHistory: false)
                    .set... // you can set more parameters
                    .execute()
} catch {
  // catch any error that may occurs on api call.  
}
```

### Android/JVM setup

Add the following line to import the library via Gradle. First, make sure Maven Central has been added:


```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    // ...
}
```

Then, simply import the dependency to your `build.gradle` dependencies:

```kotlin
implementation("co.yml:ychat:1.4.1")
```

Take a look at the Kotlin code snippet below for an example of how to initialize and use one of the supported features:


```kotlin
val yChat by lazy {
  YChat.create("your-api-key")
}

try {
  val result = yChat.completion()
     .setInput("Say this is a test.")
     .saveHistory(false)
     .setMaxTokens(1024)
     .set... // you can set more parameters
     .execute()
  
} catch (e: exception) {
  // catch any error that may occurs on api call.  
}
```
