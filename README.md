# YChatGPT

ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that is trained to generate human-like text based on a given prompt or context.

YChatGPT aims to abstract all API call logic from ChatGPT for multiple platforms. YChatGPT is a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) project, that generates artifacts for both iOS and Android.


## iOS setup

- Go to your project‚Äôs file settings and click "Add Package":

- To add a new package, search for https://github.com/yml-org/chatgpt-sdk.git in the top right corner:

Once you have found the package click the "Add Package" button to add it to your project. Now you can start using the SDK in your iOS project!

See the code snippet below on how to initialize and use it:

```swift
var yChatGpt: YChatGpt {
    YChatGptCompanion.shared.create(apiKey: "your-api-key") 
}

do {
  let result = try await chatGpt.completion()
                    .setInput(input: "Say this is a test.")
                    .setMaxTokens(tokens: 1024)
                    .saveHistory(isSaveHistory: false)
                    .set... // you can set more parameters
                    .execute()
} catch {
  // catch any error that may occurs on api call.  
}
```

## Android setup

Add the following line to import the library via Gradle. First, make sure Maven Central has been added:


```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    // ...
}
```

Then, simply import the dependency to your common source-set dependencies:

```kotlin
implementation("co.yml:ychatgpt:1.0.0")
```

In the snippet below, you can see how to initialize the object and perform a first search:


```kotlin
val yChatGpt by lazy {
  YChatGpt.create("your-api-key")
}

try {
  val result = yChatGpt.completion()
     .setInput("Say this is a test.")
     .saveHistory(false)
     .setMaxTokens(1024)
     .set... // you can set more parameters
     .execute()
  
} catch (e: exception) {
  // catch any error that may occurs on api call.  
}
```
