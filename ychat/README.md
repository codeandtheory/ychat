### Android/JVM setup

Add the following line to import the library via Gradle. First, make sure Maven Central has been added:

```

Then, simply import the dependency to your `build.gradle` dependencies:

```

## üß¨ Features

Using the `Provider` class, you can choose the provider that will implement the functionality. See below an example of how to initialize the SDK, passing the provider:

#### Swift
```swift
var yChat: YChat {
    YChatCompanion.shared.create(provider: .OpenAi(apiKey: "teste"))
}
```

#### Kotlin
```kotlin
val yChat = YChat.create(Provider.OpenAi(apiKey = "your-api-key"))
```

After obtaining the `YChat` instance, you can start calling the functionality you want. See below an example of using the `completions` functionality with OpenAI as the provider:

#### Swift
```swift
do {
    let yChat = YChatCompanion
        .shared
        .create(provider: .OpenAi(apiKey: "your-api-key"))
    try await yChat.completions()
        .setPrompt(prompt: "As descartes said")
        .execute()
} catch {
    // handle exception
}
```

#### Kotlin
```kotlin
val yChat = YChat.create(Provider.OpenAi(apiKey = "your-api-key"))
try {
    val result = yChat
        .completions()
        .setPrompt("As descartes said")
        .execute()
} catch (yChatException: YChatException) {
    // handle exception
}
```
